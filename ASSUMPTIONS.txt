Assumptions:
Multiple arguments can be provided on the command line, and each of
  these should be evaluated as an independent expression.
The scope of a reference defined by a let expression is limited to the
  expression provided in the 3rd parameter of the let expression. (This
  is implied by the structure of a let expression.)
Variables defined in a parent let expression can be shadowed by those of
  the same name defined in a child let expression.
The use of unbound variables should result in an exception.
Function names are case-insensitive.
Number values must be in decimal notation (i.e. hex, octal, etc. are not
  supported).
Floating point values and integers should be supported.
Whitespace should be ignored.
Uses of function names as variable names rather than as the target of a
  call will generate an exception.
