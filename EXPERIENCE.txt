===== Discussion =====

I decided early on in the development process to write all the code
myself rather than using third-party modules. In light of the need to
accommodate an quicker-than-expected schedule, I probably would have
used Args4J and Log4J for option parsing and logging respectively, and
perhaps ANTLR for generating a lexer and parser (though this would have
reduced my task to simply writing a grammar and implementing the logic
of the operators).

In general, I think the program works mostly as expected, though I'm
sure that bugs remain. The logging levels are implemented, but there
are few places in the code where the logging functions are called. Given
more time, I would implement more logging points, in addition to general
code cleanup/refactoring, better error messages, and more testing. I
would also add timestamps to the log entries.

See the file ASSUMPTIONS.txt for a list of assumptions that I made about
the assignment. I chose to allow decimal numbers as input and the output
is printed in Java's representation of doubles (with at least 1
significant digit after the decimal). I realized later that the input
was intended to be restricted to integers, but hopefully this deviation
is acceptable. (The requirements regarding non-integer output were
unspecified.)

The file TIME.txt includes a log of the time I spent working on various
parts of the application. It was an enjoyable exercise.
